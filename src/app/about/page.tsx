          <h2 className="mb-3">Email Phising</h2>
          <p>
            Phishing is a type of cyber-attack that aims to trick you into
            disclosing sensitive or confidential information, like your login
            credentials, financial data, or personal details. Scammers use fake
            emails that appear to be from trusted sources, such as banks,
            government agencies, or well-known companies, to deceive you. These
            deceptive emails are crafted to make you take specific actions, like
            clicking on harmful links or downloading infected attachments. So,
            it&apos;s important for you to stay vigilant and verify the
            authenticity of emails to protect your information and online
            security.
